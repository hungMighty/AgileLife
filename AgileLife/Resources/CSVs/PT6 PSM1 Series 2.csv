Developers sign up to own backlog items at the Sprint Planning.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"The ownership of the items and tasks are shared. The items are not even ""assigned"" to developers because they require multiple expertise. Only the tasks are assigned and even then, their ownership is shared.",The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is less likely to be used by a Scrum Team?,multiple-choice,"Large screen, planning poker cards","Wiki, online forum","WBS, Gantt Chart","Digital camera, task board",,,3,WBS and Gantt Charts are used in traditional projects because they are focused on an upfront understanding of the scope of the project. The scope of Agile projects evolve during the project.,The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who can change the Sprint Backlog during the Sprint?,multiple-choice,The Development Team,No one,The Development Team and the Product Owner together,The Product Owner,,,1,"The Product Backlog items in the Sprint Backlog do not change but another element in the Sprint Backlog is the tasks and they are always changing. This is the responsibility of the Development Team to make changes in the Sprint Backlog tasks; while they may also ""consult"" the Product Owner for this.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Sprint Review is a formal meeting that requires sign-off by the stakeholders,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,Sprint Review is used for informal collaboration and creating feedback. It's not a formal meeting with signed approvals and handovers.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A baselined Product Backlog is called:,multiple-choice,Release plan,Product Backlog is not baselined in Scrum,Sprint Backlog,Product vision,"""Ready"" Product Backlog",,2,"""Baselining"" is a term used in traditional environments for referring to a finalized upfront plan that would be followed in the future and used for evaluating the actual performance. There's no upfront planning and no baselines in Scrum.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"While the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint Backlog stay the same, the tasks created by decomposing them always change and emerge during the Sprint.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Product Owner ""owns"" the Product Backlog.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"The Product Owner is the sole responsible person and they even ""own"" the Product Backlog. Note: remember that the Sprint Backlog is owned by the Development Team. This is not in contrast to the fact that the Product Backlog items are estimated by the developers; they provide this information to the Product Owner to be included in the Product Backlog. There are multiple implications by saying that the Product Owner ""owns"" the Product Backlog or is the sole responsible person, including: (a) Only they can add items to the backlog or decompose them into smaller items; while this is done by input from the customers and developers, and even the Product Owner can delegate this responsibility to the developers. (b) Only they can decide on the order of the items on the Product Backlog, while this is usually based on the input from customers and developers.",The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Which two of the following are true about Scrum? (Choose 2 answers),multi-select,Scrum is a methodology for managing complex projects.,Scrum is like traditional processes but with Sprints and related artifacts.,Scrum is a framework for developing and maintaining complex products.,Scrum is based on empirical process control theory,,,"3,4","Scrum is a framework, not a methodology or body of knowledge. Scrum is empirical, rather than theoretical. Scrum is more about project delivery rather than project management. Scrum is adaptive, rather than predictive (it's more than just using Sprints and related artifacts). Scrum should be used in its entirety (we do not tailor it).",Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Only the Scrum Team is allowed to attend the Sprint Planning.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Everyone is free to ""attend"" the events as long as their participation is beneficial.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The number of developers has increased from 7 to 14. Now the Daily Scrums do not fit in 15 minutes. What's the best response to this problem?,multiple-choice,Increase the timebox of Daily Scrums to 30 minutes.,Help the team understand the importance of smaller group sizes and let them self-organize into separate teams with minimum dependency.,Help the team self-organize and finish the Daily Scrums in 15 minutes.,Finish the Daily Scrums in 15 minutes and let as many developers talk as possible.,,,2,"The maximum suggested number of Development Team members is 9. If more is needed, it's possible to use scaled Scrum (more than one team working on the same product).",The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When does the Development Team prepare the tools and infrastructure for the development?,multiple-choice,Throughout the project,Before the first Sprint,In Sprint zero,,,,1,"We do not prepare the infrastructure and tools upfront because it requires an understanding of the whole product, which is against the adaptive concept. The required infrastructure and tools depend on the product we're going to create, which in turn is defined through the project. The infrastructure and tools will be prepared gradually though the project. There's no Sprint zero in Scrum. All Sprints are the same; to create an Increment of working software.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scrum is a lightweight development methodology.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Scrum is referred to as a ""framework"" rather than a ""methodology"".",Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is the single source of requirements for all changes to the product?,multiple-choice,The Increment,The Product Backlog,The Sprint Backlog,The Sprint Retrospective,The Sprint Review,The product vision,2,"Everything we might want to apply to the product, including changes, are reflected in the Product Backlog. It's high-level but contains everything.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Product Owner should invite stakeholders to the Sprint Retrospective.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"The Product Owner invites the stakeholders to the Sprint Review meeting. The Sprint Retrospective is internal to the team. As usual, others can attend but they cannot participate.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who monitors the remaining work of the Sprint Backlog?,multiple-choice,The Scrum Team,The Scrum Master,The Development Team,The Product Owner,,,3,The Product Owner is responsible for measuring the progress of the project and tracking the remaining work in the Product Backlog. The Development Team is responsible for measuring the progress of the Sprint and tracking the remaining work in the Sprint Backlog.,Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Product Backlog is baselined at the beginning of the project.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,We don't baseline any artifact in Scrum. The Product Backlog is dynamic and never complete.,Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Which statement best describes the definition of ""Done""?",multiple-choice,Everything that would make the output potentially releasable,Anything that the Product Owner finds necessary,Passing the QA and having all the required documents,,,,1,"The definition of ""Done"" helps us understand when everything is done on a Product Backlog item and is part of the Increment. The definition of ""Done"" is defined by the development organization or the Development Team, rather than the Product Owner.",Artifact Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Each Sprint Backlog item should be owned by a Development Team member.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,Items and tasks in the Sprint Backlog are not owned by any specific person; ownership and accountability is shared. Tasks are assigned to one developer or a pair of developers but they don't own the task; they are just responsible for doing the task and everyone stays accountable (owner). The Sprint Backlog items are not even assigned to people because each item requires multiple expertise and usually done with the help of multiple people in the team.,Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's velocity?,multiple-choice,Average lines of code created per Sprint,Average amount of work done per Sprint,Average man-hours spent per Sprint,Average number of items done per Sprint,,,2,"Velocity is the amount of work (usually in ""story points"") done per Sprint. For example, 200 story points per Sprint.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
