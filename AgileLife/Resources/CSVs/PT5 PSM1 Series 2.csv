It is forecasted that the project will be over in 4 Sprints. The Product Owner wants to design acceptance tests for all items. What's the best response from the Scrum Master?,multiple-choice,"It's a good idea, as long as the tests are not too detailed.","It's a good idea, as long as there's a similar set of acceptance tests for all items.","This is not necessary. The items should be discussed in more detail before development, rather than upfront.",,,,3,Scrum doesn't use upfront planning and design and what's described in this question is a form of upfront preparation.,Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Development Team is self-organized, and therefore, can decide to drop the Daily Scrums.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,The developers are self-organized and make decisions but only inside the borders set by Scrum. Scrum events should not be dropped.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is not improved by using timeboxed Sprints?,multiple-choice,Technical debt,Prioritization of all aspects of work,Establishing work-in-progress limit,Demonstrating incremental progress,,,1,"Technical debt is any shortcoming in the solution that makes it less than ""good enough"" and might create problems in the future. Refactoring is a common way of reducing technical debt. Timeboxing, however, doesn't help with technical debt. Timeboxing the Sprints forces everyone to focus on the most important parts of the work (prioritization). It also ensures there will be frequent increments which demonstrate progress. When working inside timeboxes, it's better to limit work-in-progress and get items done before going to the next ones; otherwise, chances would be high that the team ends up with many in-progress items and not enough ""Done"" items at the end of the Sprint.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Time can be allocated between the two Sprints for integration.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Integration is part of the definition of ""Done"" and should happen as part of the development during the Sprint. Each new Sprint starts immediately after the previous one; there's no time between the two.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What happens to the incomplete Product Backlog items when the Sprint is over?,multiple-choice,"They won't be re-estimated, and they would be moved back to the Product Backlog.","They won't be re-estimated, and would be moved to the next Sprint Backlog.",They would be re-estimated and moved back to the Product Backlog.,,,,3,"The items should be re-estimated because they have been partially done and the effort will have been changed as more has been learned. Whenever an item is not done during the Sprint (for cancellation or reaching the end of the timebox), it would be moved back to the Product Backlog, rather than the next Sprint Backlog. This is so, because the Product Owner might reorder them and they won't be on the top of the Product Backlog anymore.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If there are 60 developers for a Scrum project, how should they be divided into teams?",multiple-choice,The Scrum Masters decide,The Product Owner decides,The senior management decides,The developers should decide,They don't have be divided,,4,"Each Scrum team can have a maximum of 9 members. When more developers are required, multiple teams can work on the same product and it will be called Scaled Scrum. The developers are self-organized and decide how to form the teams.",The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A company has four products. Which two of the following are acceptable ways of forming Scrum teams?,multi-select,There should be one Product Owner for each product,There can be a single Product Owner for all products,There should be a single Product Owner for all products,There can be one Product Owner for each product,,,"2,4","When there's one product, there should be only one Product Owner, even if the product is large and there are many Development Teams. However, when there are multiple products, there are two options: (a) consider them separate and have a Product Owner for each of them (b) have only one Product Owner for all of them and develop them like a larger project to ensure compatibility.",The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following are optional in Scrum? (choose 2 answers),multi-select,Increment,"Definition of ""Done""",Velocity,Burn-down charts,Sprint Backlog,,"3,4","Velocity calculations and the use of burn-down charts are common and recommended but not mandatory. The rest are the Scrum artifacts. All Scrum roles, events and artifacts are mandatory.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which statement is correct about Product Backlog refinement?,multiple-choice,It shouldn't consume more than 20% of the capacity of the Scrum Team,It shouldn't consume more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team,It shouldn't consume more than 20% of the capacity of the Development Team,It shouldn't consume more than 10% of the capacity of the Scrum Team,,,2,The 10% limit is only for the developers because their main responsibility is to develop the product and refinement shouldn't be a distraction for them. Refinement is one of the main responsibilities of the Product Owner and they usually spend a high percentage of their time on it.,Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"No one is allowed to participate in the Daily Scrum, but the developers.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Anyone can ""attend"" the Daily Scrum but only the Development Team members are allowed to ""participate"".",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which artifact contains a plan for realizing the Sprint Goal?,multiple-choice,None,Sprint Backlog,Product Backlog,Gantt Chart,Product Vision,,2,The Sprint Backlog is the set of items selected from the Product Backlog and a number of tasks required for developing them and realizing the Sprint Goal.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What happens to the Product Backlog when the end users' environment and needs change in the middle of the project?,multiple-choice,"There's no effect. If the changes are extreme, the project should be cancelled and a new one started with a new Product Backlog.",It evolves to reflect the changes,"It will be archived, and a new Product Backlog would replace it","The requirement specification document should change accordingly, followed by the Product Backlog.",,,2,"The Product Backlog is a dynamic concept that is not completely composed in the beginning of the project (or any other time) and is never made static by baselining. The Product Backlog always changes to reflect the feedback from the customer, end users, market and their environment. It's fair to say that the whole framework is designed in a way that enables such a responsive Product Backlog.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which item is NOT an attribute of the Product Backlog?,multiple-choice,Estimate,Description,Value,Owner,,,4,"Each Product Backlog has a description, a business value used for ordering and an estimate for the amount of effort.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Scrum Master shouldn't allow the Development Team start developing without having the tasks identified and assigned.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,There are two problems in this statement:(a) The Scrum Master doesn't manage the team and cannot forbid team members from doing something and cannot order them to do certain things. (b) The Development Team identify the tasks and assign them gradually throughout the Sprint. We don't do it upfront in the beginning of the Sprint.,The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scrum mandates the use of burn-down charts.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,It's common and recommended to use burn-down charts but they are not mandatory.,Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
How can a Scrum Master help multiple teams keep their output aligned in a single product?,multiple-choice,Teach the Product Owner to collaborate with lead developers on aligning the effort.,Teach them that it's their responsibility to work with the other teams to create aligned outputs and an integrated Increment.,"Collect Sprint Backlog tasks of all teams, make them consistent, and return them to team to work on",Visit Daily Scrums and ensure that team activities are aligned,,,2,The answer should be compatible with the self-organization concept; the Scrum Master or the Product Owner is not supposed to do anything directly in this regard; it's on the responsibility of the Development Team(s) to find their way.,The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is done in the first Sprint?,multiple-choice,Planning the project,Developing the product vision,Completing the reference architecture,Creating a shippable piece of functionality,,,4,There's no difference between the first Sprint and the next ones. The main purpose is creating Increments.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Which statement is least accurate about the definition of ""Done""?",multiple-choice,It's created by the Product Owner,"There can be more than one definition of ""Done"" when multiple teams are working on the same product.",It may be defined by the development organization,,,,1,"The definition of ""Done"" can be prepared in the development organization and used in all projects as a minimum. If additional content is required for the definition or it's not prepared in the organization level, the Development Team would be responsible for preparing it. The definition of ""Done"" can evolve during the project as more is learned. It's also dependent on the project and its environment. Multiple teams can have different definitions of ""Done"", as long as they are compatible and capable of creating an integrated Increment at the end of the Sprint.",Artifact Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which two statements are right about technical debt?,multi-select,"When measured properly, the Product Owner can estimate when the product is ready for release",The Development Team should not start working on a new item unless they remove all existing technical debt,"It creates uncertainty, because when more code is added, more problems will occur and the development slows down",It creates false assumptions about the current state of the system; e.g. it might not be really releasable.,,,"3,4","Technical debt is the consequence of poor system design and architecture which can happen when they are done gradually in an adaptive environment. The Development Team should be careful with it and repay it with continuous refactoring. Refactoring is improving the code without changing the external behavior. If the technical debt keeps increasing because the team doesn't refactor, development will become harder day after day and it will slow down the progress on one hand and create problems for releases on the other hand.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Hardening Sprints are helpful for defect management and integration.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"There's no hardening Sprints in Scrum. All Sprints are the same and create Increments. ""Hardening"" is done during all Sprints.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
