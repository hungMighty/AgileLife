(Choose 2 answers),multi-select,Creating a complete Product Backlog,Creating a piece of working software,Creating a releasable Increment,Designing the complete architecture,,,"1,4","The Product Backlog is a dynamic concept that is never complete; especially, at the beginning of the project. Trying to prepare a complete Product Backlog at the beginning of the project is a form of upfront planning that doesn't suit Agile environments. The same goes for the architecture; it's not designed upfront, because we don't know exactly what we're going to develop.

All Sprints have the same purpose of bringing value to the customer by creating a potentially releasable Increment.",Scrum Events

It is so, because we want all of them to be accountable for everything and to collaborate with each other.
Each person has his/her own area of expertise, such as testing, and that person will be more focused on testing tasks but it doesn't mean that we can call the person ""tester"".",The Scrum Team
It is OK for the items at the bottom of the Product Backlog to have less detail compared to those that the top.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Items on the bottom of the Product Backlog won't be developed soon, therefore, we don't need to spend too much time on them.

However, this is up to the Product Owner to reject this request, rather than the developers. So, they should just refer the customer to the Product Owner. In very special cases, the new feature might be so special and the project environment so influenced that the introduction of the new feature makes the current Sprint Goal invalid and therefore the Product Owner will cancel the Sprint. Remember, this doesn't happen often.",The Scrum Team
The Development Team is free to change its engineering practices whenever they want.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"The Development Team is self-organized and cross-functional; they have to decide how best to handle their development and this decision can evolve during the project as more is learned about the needs.

(Choose 2 answers),multi-select,In one or two preceding Sprints,In the time between the two Sprints,"During the Sprint, if they have not been refined in the previous Sprints",In Sprint 0,,,"1,3","Product Backlog refinement is a continuous activity. When an item is at the top of the backlog, which means it will be developed in the near future, more refinements are usually needed to make sure it is clear and contains just enough details (not all possible details).
It's preferred to have the items that will be selected in the Sprint Backlog completely refined before Sprint Planning; however, it's OK to have more refinement done during the development.
Remember that there's no such thing as Sprint 0 and there's no time between two Sprints that can be spent on something such as refinement.

(Choose 3 answers)",multi-select,Increments would be more complete,Increments would be closer to being potentially shippable,Increased transparency of the Increments,Reporting would be easier for the project manager,,,"1,2,3","Items are not really done unless we have tested them; so, tests should be included in the definition of ""Done"". In this case, the Increments will be closer to what we can practically call ""complete"", ""done"", ""potentially releasable"", or ""potentially shippable""; to something useable for the users.

Increments should be potentially releasable; for starters, because it makes it easier for the customer to try it and give feedback. The feedback enables adaptation, which is essential to Agile.

Having an effective definition of ""Done"" increases transparency because everyone will know what we mean when we say an items is done.",Artifact Transparency

They should also be clear and detailed enough; but not too detailed (eg not with all tasks need to be identified) as it would be upfront planning. Tasks are created gradually during the Sprint.
Product Backlog items require multiple expertise and usually done by multiple developers. Therefore, they are not assigned. Tasks, however, are assigned to the individual developers, while everyone stays accountable.",Scrum Artifacts

When is a Sprint Backlog item considered complete?,multiple-choice,When all of its tasks are complete,When the Sprint is over,"When everything is done based on the definition of ""Done""",When the user acceptance tests are done,,,3,"When the item is complete based on the definition of ""Done"", the end users can use it and it creates an Increment of working software which is potentially releasable.

Note: if all the tasks for an item are complete, it doesn't necessarily mean that the item is complete because we might have forgotten to add some of the tasks.",Artifact Transparency
Which statement best describes the Sprint Backlog?,multiple-choice,Each of its items has been estimated in hours,It's the Development Team's plan for the Sprint,It's composed by the Product Owner,Each of its items are assigned to a team member,,,2,"The Sprint Backlog is created during the Sprint Planning and includes the items selected from the Product Backlog (by the Development Team) and the tasks created by decomposing the items (by the Development Team).
Developers keep adding tasks during the Sprint, so the Sprint Backlog updates. It's the Development Team's plan for the current Sprint. This plan is not detailed upfront.
If the Development Team cannot deliver some of the items, they will go back to the Product Backlog and will be ordered again; they do not go to the next Sprint automatically.
Each task is assigned to one developer or a pair of developers but the ownership is still shared. Items are not assigned or owned by specific developers, all of them share accountability.",Scrum Artifacts
When is a Sprint cancelled?,multiple-choice,When a key developer cannot work for awhile,When the Sprint Goal doesn't make sense anymore,When all Sprint Backlog items won't be finished until the end of the Sprint,"When the definition of ""Done"" is met",,,2,Sprints are cancelled by the Product Owner only because they don't make sense anymore or become obsolete. It's mainly about the Sprint Goal.,Scrum Events

The Scrum Master is supposed to teach and coach.,The Scrum Team
Each Development Team member should be cross-functional.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"The Development Team as a whole is cross-functional, which means the sum of all developers with their different expertise. It doesn't mean that we need to have cross-functional individuals or ""Development Team members"".
Each individual is an expert in one or more technical layer or aspect of the project and the team they create is cross-functional (having all the expertise required to get the job done, without any need for external resources).",The Scrum Team
Who supports the Scrum Master in removing impediments? (Choose 2 answers),multi-select,The customer,The senior management,The Product Owner,The Development Team,,,"2,4",The Development Team can help the Scrum Master because of their understanding of how the work is done. Some impediments are rooted in external causes and that's why the Scrum Master might need to have the senior management's support in removing them.,The Scrum Team
Why is Daily Scrum at the same time and same place?,multiple-choice,Because the place can be named,Because the Product Owner requires it,To reduce complexity and increase simplicity,To make it easier to book the rooms,,,3,"It's not wise to spend some time everyday scheduling the next Daily Scrum when the meeting itself is only 15 minutes.
We usually expect to have a common place for the team and have them collocated. The meeting will be held in the same common place (ie in front of the Scrum board); we don't book a meeting room for it.",Scrum Events
When should Increments be shipped?,multiple-choice,When the Increment is free of defects,When it makes sense,After each Sprint,When the Increment is shippable,,,2,All Increments should be potentially releasable (shippable) but we don't have to release all of them.

Refactoring is a common way of reducing technical debt. Timeboxing, however, doesn't help with technical debt. Timeboxing the Sprints forces everyone to focus on the most important parts of the work (prioritization). It also ensures there will be frequent increments which demonstrate progress.
