However, nothing stops our flow of Sprints. For example, we do not delay the Sprint because the items are not ready. In such cases, the ""unready"" items would be selected for the Sprint and refined during the Sprint.

What would be your response as the Scrum Master?,multiple-choice,There's nothing wrong with it.,"Burn-up charts are used in traditional methods, and should be replaced by burn-down charts.",,,,,1,"Burn-down charts are very common for tracking and representing progress, but they are not mandatory and the Product Owner can use other tools/techniques as well.",The Scrum Team
Scrum is an iterative and incremental Agile framework.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Scrum is iterative because processes are repeated in each Sprint. It's incremental because it delivers the product in multiple incremental steps instead of in a big bang.

Which element helps limit work-in-progress?,multiple-choice,Using timeboxes,Using Sprint Review,Using Product Backlogs,Using Sprint Retrospective,,,1,"When working inside timeboxes, it's better to limit work-in-progress and get items done before going to the next ones; otherwise chances would be high that the team ends up with many in-progress items and not enough ""Done"" items at the end of the Sprint.

Which of the following is a way of decreasing technical debt?,multiple-choice,Hiring an external auditor,"Improving the definition of ""Done""",Having hardening Sprints,,,,2,"There's usually room for improving the definition of ""Done"". A good definition will let less technical debt pass on to the next Sprints.

Technical debt is minor shortcomings in the code that makes it less than ""good enough"" and therefore creates risks in the future. It usually decreases velocity in the future (because the team has to fix the shortcomings) and as some of the debt might remain in the final product, the maintenance cost will increase as well.

Another Agile way of reducing technical debt is continuous refactoring.",Artifact Transparency
Which of the following is the shortest timebox in a two-week Sprint?,multiple-choice,Sprint Retrospective,Sprint Planning,Sprint Review,,,,1,"These are the durations in a two-week Sprint:

It is OK for the items at the bottom of the Product Backlog not to be as clear as those at the top.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Items at the bottom of the Product Backlog won't be developed soon, so, there's no need to spend too much time making them clear and add details; that would be some kind of upfront planning. Not that the items do not go to the bottom of the backlog because they are not clear or do not have enough detail; the only basis for order of items is the business value.

Therefore, we're creating more value now, compared to the past.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Velocity and value are not related directly. Value is the benefit to cost ratio.

When an item is at the top of the backlog, which means it will be developed in the near future, more refinements are usually needed to make sure it is clear and contains just enough details (not all possible details). It's preferred to have the items that will be selected in the Sprint Backlog completely refined before Sprint Planning; however, it's OK to have more refinement done during the development. Remember that there's no such thing as Sprint 0 and there's no time between two Sprints that can be spent on something such as refinement.
