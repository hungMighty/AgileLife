"When multiple teams are working on the same product, their Sprints should be synchronized, and their outputs should be integrated into one integrated Increment.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"The output created by each team should be potentially releasable and then they will be packaged into one integrated Increment.

This means that each Product Backlog item would be handled by one team and each team should be cross-functional.

Teams should synchronize their Sprints in a way that reduces complexity. This could require them to start and finish their Sprints inthe same time.",Scrum Events

Scrum is an iterative and incremental Agile framework.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Scrum is iterative because processes are repeated in each Sprint. It's incremental because it delivers the product in multiple incremental steps instead of in a big bang.

And of course it's Agile (adaptive instead of predictive).",Scrum Theory
Which element helps limit work-in-progress?,multiple-choice,Using timeboxes,Using Sprint Review,Using Product Backlogs,Using Sprint Retrospective,,,1,"When working inside timeboxes, it's better to limit work-in-progress and get items done before going to the next ones; otherwise chances would be high that the team ends up with many in-progress items and not enough ""Done"" items at the end of the Sprint.

Limiting work-in-progress is a lean concept that avoids waste.",Scrum Events
Ordering the Product Backlog items is part of the Product Backlog refinement.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Product Backlog refinement is defined in the Scrum Guide as the act of adding detail, estimates and order to the Product Backlog items.

Therefore, we're creating more value now, compared to the past.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Velocity and value are not related directly. Value is the benefit to cost ratio. Since we start with the most important items first, those remained for the 11th Sprint are expected to have less value compared to those delivered at the 6th Sprint.",Scrum Theory
"Which of the following roles can set the definition of ""Done""?",multiple-choice,The Scrum Team,The Scrum Master,The Development Team,The Product Owner,,,3,"The development organization may have a definition of ""Done"" composed for all projects in which case the team will use it as a minimum.

When should the Product Backlog items be refined? (choose 2 answers),multi-select,Before the Sprint in which the item is supposed to be developed,The business analysts do it before it is time to develop the item,"During the Sprint, if they have not been refined in the previous Sprints",,,,"1,3","Product Backlog refinement is a continuous activity. When an item is at the top of the backlog, which means it will be developed in the near future, more refinements are usually needed to make sure it is clear and contains just enough details (not all possible details). It's preferred to have the items that will be selected in the Sprint Backlog completely refined before Sprint Planning; however, it's OK to have more refinement done during the development. Remember that there's no such thing as Sprint 0 and there's no time between two Sprints that can be spent on something such as refinement. The team is also cross-functional and does the a-z of the work needed for each item, including refinement; they don't use people from other parts of the company.",Scrum Artifacts

In that case, they would have the potential of creating a releasable/shippable Increment that is usable by the end user. Tests are also part of the work and items are not ""Done"" before the tests are complete; even the user acceptance tests. Quality requirements are part of the work but not all of it (eg non-functional features and development processes are also part of the work).
