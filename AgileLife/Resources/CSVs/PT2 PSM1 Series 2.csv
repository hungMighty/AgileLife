,Question Type (multiple-choice or multi-select),Answer Option 1,Answer Option 2,Answer Option 3,Answer Option 4,Answer Option 5,Answer Option 6,Correct Response,Explanation,Knowledge Area,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
A company has three products. Which two of the following are acceptable way of forming Scrum teams?,multi-select,There can be one Product Owner for each product,There should be one Product Owner for each product,There can be a single Product Owner for all products,There should be a single Product Owner for all products,,,"1,3","When there's one product, there should be only one Product Owner, even if the product is large and there are many Development Teams. However, when there are multiple products, there are two options:
a) considering them separate and have a Product Owner for each of them
b) have only one Product Owner for all of them and develop them like a larger project to ensure compatibility.",The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When forming multiple Scrum teams, which two of the following are the most important considerations?",multi-select,Having proper size in each team,Having an effective mixture of skill in each team to avoid dependencies,Having a mixture of senior and junior developers in each team,Having enough skills for the technical layer designated to the each team,,,"1,2",All teams should be cross-functional with 3 to 9 members.,The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"If it's not possible to complete the Sprint Backlog, who would try to resolve it?",multiple-choice,The Development Team,The Scrum Master,The Development Team and the Product Owner,The Product Owner,The Scrum Team,,3,"First of all, it's OK of the Sprint Backlog is not complete until the end of the Sprint. However, we would try to complete it if it's possible. When the developers find out they are behind schedule they will ask the Product Owner for help and the two roles together will adjust the work (tasks), or reorder the times to make sure the highest value will be created at the end of the Sprint.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When multiple teams are working on the same product, their Sprints should be synchronized, and their outputs should be integrated into one integrated Increment.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"The output created by each team should be potentially releasable and then they will be packaged into one integrated Increment.

This means that each Product Backlog item would be handled by one team and each team should be cross-functional.

Teams should synchronize their Sprints in a way that reduces complexity. This could require them to start and finish their Sprints inthe same time.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Teams A and B work on two different projects. Team A has 8 members, and a velocity of 600. Team B has 6 members, and a velocity of 500. Which team has a higher performance?",multiple-choice,Team B,Team A,It depends,,,,3,The provided information is not enough. Velocity is defined locally and it's not possible to compare one team's velocity with the other.,Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following does NOT apply to/suit Scrum?,multiple-choice,Static requirements,Based on empirical process control,Difficult to master,Process framework used to address complex products,,,1,"Agile is all about depending on adaptation, instead of predictive (static, upfront) plan and design.",Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Product Owner is using burn-up charts instead of burn-down charts. What would be your response as the Scrum Master?,multiple-choice,There's nothing wrong with it.,"Burn-up charts are used in traditional methods, and should be replaced by burn-down charts.",,,,,1,"Burn-down charts are very common for tracking and representing progress, but they are not mandatory and the Product Owner can use other tools/techniques as well.",The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scrum is an iterative and incremental Agile process.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Scrum is iterative because processes are repeated in each Sprint. It's incremental because it delivers the product in multiple incremental steps instead of in a big bang.

And of course it's Agile (adaptive instead of predictive).",Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which element helps limit work-in-progress?,multiple-choice,Using timeboxes,Using Sprint Review,Using Product Backlogs,Using Sprint Retrospective,,,1,"When working inside timeboxes, it's better to limit work-in-progress and get items done before going to the next ones; otherwise chances would be high that the team ends up with many in-progress items and not enough ""Done"" items at the end of the Sprint.

Limiting work-in-progress is a lean concept that avoids waste.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Who's in the Scrum Team? (Choose multiple answers),multi-select,Scrum Master,Development Team,Project manager,Product Owner,Team leader(s),,"1,2,4",Not all questions will this easy but you should still read them very carefully as they can easily be misinterpreted.,The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is not a pillar of Scrum?,multiple-choice,Transparency,Inspection,Empiricism,Adaptation,,,3,"The three pillars of Scrum are adaptation, inspection and transparency. Scrum is based on empiricism but it's not one of the pillars.",Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Which statement is least accurate about the definition of ""Done""?",multiple-choice,It may evolve during the project,It's created by the Product Owner,It may vary depending on the project,It may be defined by the development organization,,,2,"The definition of ""Done"" can be prepared in the development organization and used in all projects as a minimum. If additional content is required for the definition or it's not prepared in the organization level, the Development Team would be responsible for preparing it.

The definition of ""Done"" can evolve during the project as more is learned. It's also dependent on the project and its environment.",Artifact Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Product Backlog is reordered by the stakeholders at the Sprint Review meeting.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,Only the Product Owner can order the Product Backlog. This can be influenced by other stakeholders but the Product Owner always has the final say.,Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When multiple teams are working on the same product, who should make sure that their outputs can be integrated into one Increment?",multiple-choice,The developers,The developers and the Product Owner,The Product Owner,The Scrum Master,,,1,It's up to the developers to find their way and ensure that their outputs will create an integrated Increment that is potentially releasable.,The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which statements are correct about Sprint Retrospective meeting? (Choose 2 answers),multi-select,It happens before the Sprint Review,It's an opportunity for inspection and adaptation,It's three hours in a one-month Sprint,It's the only time improvement are planned for the project,The Product Owner doesn't have to be at the meeting,,"2,3","The Sprint Retrospective happens after the Sprint Review; it's the last event in the Sprint. It's three hours in a one-month Sprint and all Scrum Team members attend it.

Its purpose is planning for improvements in the process (the way we're working), but it's not the only time we try to improve.

Similar to Sprint Planning, Sprint Review and Daily Scrum, it's an opportunity for inspection and adaptation.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Product Backlog refinement shouldn't take more than 10% of the Product Owner's time.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,The Product Backlog refinement is done by the Product Owner and the Development Team. The rule is that it shouldn't take more than 10% of the developers' time. The Product Owner spends as much time as required on refinement.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is a way of decreasing technical debt?,multiple-choice,Hiring an external auditor,"Improving the definition of ""Done""",Having hardening Sprints,,,,2,"There's usually room for improving the definition of ""Done"". A good definition will let less technical debt pass on to the next Sprints.

Technical debt is minor shortcomings in the code that makes it less than ""good enough"" and therefore creates risks in the future. It usually decreases velocity in the future (because the team has to fix the shortcomings) and as some of the debt might remain in the final product, the maintenance cost will increase as well.

Another Agile way of reducing technical debt is continuous refactoring.",Artifact Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is the shortest timebox in a two-week Sprint?,multiple-choice,Sprint Retrospective,Sprint Planning,Sprint Review,,,,1,"These are the durations in a two-week Sprint:
- Sprint Planning: 4 hours
- Sprint Review: 2 hours
- Sprint Retrospective: 1.5 hours",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
What's the optimal length of a Sprint?,multiple-choice,Short enough to minimize risk,One week,Two weeks,One month,,,1,We prefer shorter Sprints as long as we can produce enough output. Shorter Sprints reduce the risk to the business.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"The Product Owner is responsible for the definition of ""Done"".",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"If there's a definition of ""Done"" in the development organization that would be used for all projects. Otherwise, the Development Team would be responsible for creating one.

Even when there's a definition of ""Done"" in the organization, it can be used as a minimum and the developer can add extra elements to it (eg to decrease technical debt).",Artifact Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
