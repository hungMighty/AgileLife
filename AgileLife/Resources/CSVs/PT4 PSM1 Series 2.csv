Which statement is correct when the developers are working in the middle of the Sprint?,multiple-choice,The Sprint Backlog would be frozen,No user acceptance tests will be conducted until the end of the Sprint,The scope may be clarified as more is learned,,,,3,"During the Sprint, the Product Backlog items in the Sprint Backlog would not be added or removed but as more is learned, the scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team.

Non-functional features are normally added to the definition of ""Done"" because they apply to all functional features. For some non-functional features, such as performance, it's possible to create non-technical, independent items in the Product Backlog. This is usually done when we have to make an improvement in the previously done features.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"When multiple teams are working on the same product, each team should have their own definition of ""Done"".",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"All teams can use the same definition of ""Done"" but if required they can have different definitions as long as they are compatible and capable of creating integrated Increments.

What happens when the Product Backlog is not clear enough at Sprint Planning?,multiple-choice,Nothing; the Sprint would be planned anyway.,"The Sprint would be cancelled, and the next one will start as soon as enough items at the top of the Product Backlog are clear.","The Sprint Planning would be delayed, until enough refinement is done on the items at the top of the Product Backlog.","The Sprint Planning would be extended, to have the items refined before adding them to the Sprint Backlog.",,,1,"We prefer to have ""ready"" items at the top of the Product Backlog before Sprint Planning, which is done through Product Backlog refinement. However, nothing stops our flow of Sprints, for example, we do not delay the Sprint because the items are not ready. In such cases, the ""unready"" items would be selected for the Sprint anyway and refined during the Sprint. ""Ready"" items are those that are clear and small enough to fit into one Sprint.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
