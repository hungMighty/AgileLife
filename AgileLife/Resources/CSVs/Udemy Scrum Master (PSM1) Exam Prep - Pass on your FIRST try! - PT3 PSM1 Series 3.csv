It is forecasted that the project will be over in 4 Sprints. The Product Owner wants to design acceptance tests for all items. What's the best response from the Scrum Master?,multiple-choice,"It's a good idea, as long as the tests are not too detailed.","It's a good idea, as long as there's a similar set of acceptance tests for all items.","This is not necessary. The items should be discussed in more detail before development, rather than upfront.",,,,3,Scrum doesn't use upfront planning and design and what's described in this question is a form of upfront preparation.,Scrum Theory
"The Development Team is self-organized, and therefore, can decide to drop the Daily Scrums.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,The developers are self-organized and make decisions but only inside the borders set by Scrum. Scrum events should not be dropped.,Scrum Events
Which of the following is not improved by using timeboxed Sprints?,multiple-choice,Technical debt,Prioritization of all aspects of work,Establishing work-in-progress limit,Demonstrating incremental progress,,,1,"Technical debt is any shortcoming in the solution that makes it less than ""good enough"" and might create problems in the future. Refactoring is a common way of reducing technical debt. Timeboxing, however, doesn't help with technical debt. Timeboxing the Sprints forces everyone to focus on the most important parts of the work (prioritization). It also ensures there will be frequent increments which demonstrate progress. When working inside timeboxes, it's better to limit work-in-progress and get items done before going to the next ones; otherwise, chances would be high that the team ends up with many in-progress items and not enough ""Done"" items at the end of the Sprint.",Scrum Events
Time can be allocated between the two Sprints for integration.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Integration is part of the definition of ""Done"" and should happen as part of the development during the Sprint. Each new Sprint starts immediately after the previous one; there's no time between the two.",Scrum Events
What happens to the incomplete Product Backlog items when the Sprint is over?,multiple-choice,"They won't be re-estimated, and they would be moved back to the Product Backlog.","They won't be re-estimated, and would be moved to the next Sprint Backlog.",They would be re-estimated and moved back to the Product Backlog.,,,,3,"The items should be re-estimated because they have been partially done and the effort will have been changed as more has been learned. Whenever an item is not done during the Sprint (for cancellation or reaching the end of the timebox), it would be moved back to the Product Backlog, rather than the next Sprint Backlog. This is so, because the Product Owner might reorder them and they won't be on the top of the Product Backlog anymore.",Scrum Artifacts
"If there are 60 developers for a Scrum project, how should they be divided into teams?",multiple-choice,The Scrum Masters decide,The Product Owner decides,The senior management decides,The developers should decide,They don't have be divided,,4,"Each Scrum team can have a maximum of 9 members. When more developers are required, multiple teams can work on the same product and it will be called Scaled Scrum. The developers are self-organized and decide how to form the teams.",The Scrum Team
A company has four products. Which two of the following are acceptable ways of forming Scrum teams?,multi-select,There should be one Product Owner for each product,There can be a single Product Owner for all products,There should be a single Product Owner for all products,There can be one Product Owner for each product,,,"2,4","When there's one product, there should be only one Product Owner, even if the product is large and there are many Development Teams. However, when there are multiple products, there are two options: (a) consider them separate and have a Product Owner for each of them (b) have only one Product Owner for all of them and develop them like a larger project to ensure compatibility.",The Scrum Team
Which of the following are optional in Scrum? (choose 2 answers),multi-select,Increment,"Definition of ""Done""",Velocity,Burn-down charts,Sprint Backlog,,"3,4","Velocity calculations and the use of burn-down charts are common and recommended but not mandatory. The rest are the Scrum artifacts. All Scrum roles, events and artifacts are mandatory.",Scrum Artifacts
Which statement is correct about Product Backlog refinement?,multiple-choice,It shouldn't consume more than 20% of the capacity of the Scrum Team,It shouldn't consume more than 10% of the capacity of the Development Team,It shouldn't consume more than 20% of the capacity of the Development Team,It shouldn't consume more than 10% of the capacity of the Scrum Team,,,2,The 10% limit is only for the developers because their main responsibility is to develop the product and refinement shouldn't be a distraction for them. Refinement is one of the main responsibilities of the Product Owner and they usually spend a high percentage of their time on it.,Scrum Artifacts
"No one is allowed to participate in the Daily Scrum, but the developers.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Anyone can ""attend"" the Daily Scrum but only the Development Team members are allowed to ""participate"".",Scrum Events
Which artifact contains a plan for realizing the Sprint Goal?,multiple-choice,None,Sprint Backlog,Product Backlog,Gantt Chart,Product Vision,,2,The Sprint Backlog is the set of items selected from the Product Backlog and a number of tasks required for developing them and realizing the Sprint Goal.,Scrum Events
What happens to the Product Backlog when the end users' environment and needs change in the middle of the project?,multiple-choice,"There's no effect. If the changes are extreme, the project should be cancelled and a new one started with a new Product Backlog.",It evolves to reflect the changes,"It will be archived, and a new Product Backlog would replace it","The requirement specification document should change accordingly, followed by the Product Backlog.",,,2,"The Product Backlog is a dynamic concept that is not completely composed in the beginning of the project (or any other time) and is never made static by baselining. The Product Backlog always changes to reflect the feedback from the customer, end users, market and their environment. It's fair to say that the whole framework is designed in a way that enables such a responsive Product Backlog.",Scrum Artifacts
Which item is NOT an attribute of a Product Backlog Item?,multiple-choice,Estimate,Description,Value,Owner,,,4,"Each Product Backlog Item has a description, a business value used for ordering and an estimate for the amount of effort.",Scrum Artifacts
The Scrum Master shouldn't allow the Development Team start developing without having the tasks identified and assigned.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,There are two problems in this statement:(a) The Scrum Master doesn't manage the team and cannot forbid team members from doing something and cannot order them to do certain things. (b) The Development Team identify the tasks and assign them gradually throughout the Sprint. We don't do it upfront in the beginning of the Sprint.,The Scrum Team
Scrum mandates the use of burn-down charts.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,It's common and recommended to use burn-down charts but they are not mandatory.,Scrum Artifacts
How can a Scrum Master help multiple teams keep their output aligned in a single product?,multiple-choice,Teach the Product Owner to collaborate with lead developers on aligning the effort.,Teach them that it's their responsibility to work with the other teams to create aligned outputs and an integrated Increment.,"Collect Sprint Backlog tasks of all teams, make them consistent, and return them to team to work on",Visit Daily Scrums and ensure that team activities are aligned,,,2,The answer should be compatible with the self-organization concept; the Scrum Master or the Product Owner is not supposed to do anything directly in this regard; it's on the responsibility of the Development Team(s) to find their way.,The Scrum Team
Which of the following is done in the first Sprint?,multiple-choice,Planning the project,Developing the product vision,Completing the reference architecture,Creating a shippable piece of functionality,,,4,There's no difference between the first Sprint and the next ones. The main purpose is creating Increments.,Scrum Events
"Which statement is least accurate about the definition of ""Done""?",multiple-choice,It's created by the Product Owner,"There can be more than one definition of ""Done"" when multiple teams are working on the same product.",It may be defined by the development organization,,,,1,"The definition of ""Done"" can be prepared in the development organization and used in all projects as a minimum. If additional content is required for the definition or it's not prepared in the organization level, the Development Team would be responsible for preparing it. The definition of ""Done"" can evolve during the project as more is learned. It's also dependent on the project and its environment. Multiple teams can have different definitions of ""Done"", as long as they are compatible and capable of creating an integrated Increment at the end of the Sprint.",Artifact Transparency
Which two statements are right about technical debt?,multi-select,"When measured properly, the Product Owner can estimate when the product is ready for release",The Development Team should not start working on a new item unless they remove all existing technical debt,"It creates uncertainty, because when more code is added, more problems will occur and the development slows down",It creates false assumptions about the current state of the system; e.g. it might not be really releasable.,,,"3,4","Technical debt is the consequence of poor system design and architecture which can happen when they are done gradually in an adaptive environment. The Development Team should be careful with it and repay it with continuous refactoring. Refactoring is improving the code without changing the external behavior. If the technical debt keeps increasing because the team doesn't refactor, development will become harder day after day and it will slow down the progress on one hand and create problems for releases on the other hand.",Scrum Artifacts
Hardening Sprints are helpful for defect management and integration.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"There's no hardening Sprints in Scrum. All Sprints are the same and create Increments. ""Hardening"" is done during all Sprints.",Scrum Events
Developers sign up to own backlog items at the Sprint Planning.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"The ownership of the items and tasks are shared. The items are not even ""assigned"" to developers because they require multiple expertise. Only the tasks are assigned and even then, their ownership is shared.",The Scrum Team
Which of the following is less likely to be used by a Scrum Team?,multiple-choice,"Large screen, planning poker cards","Wiki, online forum","WBS, Gantt Chart","Digital camera, task board",,,3,WBS and Gantt Charts are used in traditional projects because they are focused on an upfront understanding of the scope of the project. The scope of Agile projects evolve during the project.,The Scrum Team
Who can change the Sprint Backlog during the Sprint?,multiple-choice,The Development Team,No one,The Development Team and the Product Owner together,The Product Owner,,,1,"The Product Backlog items in the Sprint Backlog do not change but another element in the Sprint Backlog is the tasks and they are always changing. This is the responsibility of the Development Team to make changes in the Sprint Backlog tasks; while they may also ""consult"" the Product Owner for this.",Scrum Artifacts
Sprint Review is a formal meeting that requires sign-off by the stakeholders,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,Sprint Review is used for informal collaboration and creating feedback. It's not a formal meeting with signed approvals and handovers.,Scrum Events
A baselined Product Backlog is called:,multiple-choice,Release plan,Product Backlog is not baselined in Scrum,Sprint Backlog,Product vision,"""Ready"" Product Backlog",,2,"""Baselining"" is a term used in traditional environments for referring to a finalized upfront plan that would be followed in the future and used for evaluating the actual performance. There's no upfront planning and no baselines in Scrum.",Scrum Artifacts
The Sprint Backlog emerges during the Sprint.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"While the Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint Backlog stay the same, the tasks created by decomposing them always change and emerge during the Sprint.",Scrum Artifacts
"The Product Owner ""owns"" the Product Backlog.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"The Product Owner is the sole responsible person and they even ""own"" the Product Backlog. Note: remember that the Sprint Backlog is owned by the Development Team. This is not in contrast to the fact that the Product Backlog items are estimated by the developers; they provide this information to the Product Owner to be included in the Product Backlog. There are multiple implications by saying that the Product Owner ""owns"" the Product Backlog or is the sole responsible person, including: (a) Only they can add items to the backlog or decompose them into smaller items; while this is done by input from the customers and developers, and even the Product Owner can delegate this responsibility to the developers. (b) Only they can decide on the order of the items on the Product Backlog, while this is usually based on the input from customers and developers.",The Scrum Team
The Product Owner and the Scrum Master cannot tell the Development Team how to build the product.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,The Development Team is self-organized and finds its own way instead of receiving orders.,The Scrum Team
Which two of the following are true about Scrum? (Choose 2 answers),multi-select,Scrum is a methodology for managing complex projects.,Scrum is like traditional processes but with Sprints and related artifacts.,Scrum is a framework for developing and maintaining complex products.,Scrum is based on empirical process control theory,,,"3,4","Scrum is a framework, not a methodology or body of knowledge. Scrum is empirical, rather than theoretical. Scrum is more about project delivery rather than project management. Scrum is adaptive, rather than predictive (it's more than just using Sprints and related artifacts). Scrum should be used in its entirety (we do not tailor it).",Scrum Theory
Only the Scrum Team is allowed to attend the Sprint Planning.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Everyone is free to ""attend"" the events as long as their participation is beneficial.",Scrum Events
The number of developers has increased from 7 to 14. Now the Daily Scrums do not fit in 15 minutes. What's the best response to this problem?,multiple-choice,Increase the timebox of Daily Scrums to 30 minutes.,Help the team understand the importance of smaller group sizes and let them self-organize into separate teams with minimum dependency.,Help the team self-organize and finish the Daily Scrums in 15 minutes.,Finish the Daily Scrums in 15 minutes and let as many developers talk as possible.,,,2,"The maximum suggested number of Development Team members is 9. If more is needed, it's possible to use scaled Scrum (more than one team working on the same product).",The Scrum Team
When does the Development Team prepare the tools and infrastructure for the development?,multiple-choice,Throughout the project,Before the first Sprint,In Sprint zero,,,,1,"We do not prepare the infrastructure and tools upfront because it requires an understanding of the whole product, which is against the adaptive concept. The required infrastructure and tools depend on the product we're going to create, which in turn is defined through the project. The infrastructure and tools will be prepared gradually though the project. There's no Sprint zero in Scrum. All Sprints are the same; to create an Increment of working software.",Scrum Events
Scrum is a lightweight development methodology.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Scrum is referred to as a ""framework"" rather than a ""methodology"".",Scrum Theory

Who monitors the remaining work of the Sprint Backlog?,multiple-choice,The Scrum Team,The Scrum Master,The Development Team,The Product Owner,,,3,The Product Owner is responsible for measuring the progress of the project and tracking the remaining work in the Product Backlog. The Development Team is responsible for measuring the progress of the Sprint and tracking the remaining work in the Sprint Backlog.,Scrum Artifacts
The Product Backlog is baselined at the beginning of the project.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,We don't baseline any artifact in Scrum. The Product Backlog is dynamic and never complete.,Scrum Artifacts
"Which statement best describes the definition of ""Done""?",multiple-choice,Everything that would make the output potentially releasable,Anything that the Product Owner finds necessary,Passing the QA and having all the required documents,,,,1,"The definition of ""Done"" helps us understand when everything is done on a Product Backlog item and is part of the Increment. The definition of ""Done"" is defined by the development organization or the Development Team, rather than the Product Owner.",Artifact Transparency
Each Sprint Backlog item should be owned by a Development Team member.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,Items and tasks in the Sprint Backlog are not owned by any specific person; ownership and accountability is shared. Tasks are assigned to one developer or a pair of developers but they don't own the task; they are just responsible for doing the task and everyone stays accountable (owner). The Sprint Backlog items are not even assigned to people because each item requires multiple expertise and usually done with the help of multiple people in the team.,Scrum Artifacts
What's velocity?,multiple-choice,Average lines of code created per Sprint,Average amount of work done per Sprint,Average man-hours spent per Sprint,Average number of items done per Sprint,,,2,"Velocity is the amount of work (usually in ""story points"") done per Sprint. For example, 200 story points per Sprint.",Scrum Events

Which of the following does NOT happen in the first Sprint? (Choose 2 answers),multi-select,Creating a complete Product Backlog,Creating a piece of working software,Creating a releasable Increment,Designing the complete architecture,,,"1,4","The Product Backlog is a dynamic concept that is never complete; especially, at the beginning of the project. Trying to prepare a complete Product Backlog at the beginning of the project is a form of upfront planning that doesn't suit Agile environments. The same goes for the architecture; it's not designed upfront, because we don't know exactly what we're going to develop.

All Sprints have the same purpose of bringing value to the customer by creating a potentially releasable Increment.",Scrum Events
Which of the following is a responsibility of the project manager in Scrum?,multiple-choice,There's no project manager in Scrum,Making high-level decisions,Authorizing the Sprints,Planning releases,Preparing the project plan and Gantt Charts,,1,"There are only three roles in Scrum and it's not allowed to add other roles or titles: Product Owner, Scrum Master and Development Team",The Scrum Team

Which is NOT a Development Team responsibility?,multiple-choice,Volunteering for tasks,Creating tasks,Measuring their own performance,Breaking down the items in the Product Backlog into smaller items,,,4,"This is the responsibility of the Product Owner to break down the large Product Backlog items into smaller ones. The Development Team usually ""helps"" in this but it doesn't make them responsible.",The Scrum Team
Which two statements are correct during the Sprint?,multi-select,Some Sprint Backlog items would be replaced with items from the Product Backlog if the priorities change,The scope may be clarified as more is learned,The scope may be re-negotiated as more is learned,Some Sprint Backlog items would be moved back to the Product Backlog to be completed in future Sprints,,,"2,3","During the Sprint, the Product Backlog items in the Sprint Backlog would not be added or removed but as more is learned, the scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team. This is mainly focused on the interpretation of the Product Backlog items and the tasks created by decomposing them.",Scrum Events
Which of the following are optional in Scrum? (choose 2 answers),multi-select,Velocity,Having potentially releasable Increments,Release plan,Measuring Sprint performance,Product Backlog,,"1,3","Having a release plan is usually required but it's not part of the framework and is not mandatory.

It's not allowed to define new roles and the Development Team members should not have any titles; they are all ""developers"". It is so, because we want all of them to be accountable for everything and to collaborate with each other.
Each person has his/her own area of expertise, such as testing, and that person will be more focused on testing tasks but it doesn't mean that we can call the person ""tester"".",The Scrum Team
It is OK for the items at the bottom of the Product Backlog to have less detail compared to those that the top.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Items on the bottom of the Product Backlog won't be developed soon, therefore, we don't need to spend too much time on them.

However, this is up to the Product Owner to reject this request, rather than the developers. So, they should just refer the customer to the Product Owner. In very special cases, the new feature might be so special and the project environment so influenced that the introduction of the new feature makes the current Sprint Goal invalid and therefore the Product Owner will cancel the Sprint. Remember, this doesn't happen often.",The Scrum Team
The Development Team is free to change its engineering practices whenever they want.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"The Development Team is self-organized and cross-functional; they have to decide how best to handle their development and this decision can evolve during the project as more is learned about the needs.

(Choose 2 answers),multi-select,In one or two preceding Sprints,In the time between the two Sprints,"During the Sprint, if they have not been refined in the previous Sprints",In Sprint 0,,,"1,3","Product Backlog refinement is a continuous activity. When an item is at the top of the backlog, which means it will be developed in the near future, more refinements are usually needed to make sure it is clear and contains just enough details (not all possible details).
It's preferred to have the items that will be selected in the Sprint Backlog completely refined before Sprint Planning; however, it's OK to have more refinement done during the development.
Remember that there's no such thing as Sprint 0 and there's no time between two Sprints that can be spent on something such as refinement. The team is also cross-functional and does the a-z of the work needed for each item, including refinement; they don't use people from other parts of the company.",Scrum Artifacts

"What are the benefits of having tests in the definition of ""Done""? (Choose 3 answers)",multi-select,Increments would be more complete,Increments would be closer to being potentially shippable,Increased transparency of the Increments,Reporting would be easier for the project manager,,,"1,2,3","Items are not really done unless we have tested them; so, tests should be included in the definition of ""Done"". In this case, the Increments will be closer to what we can practically call ""complete"", ""done"", ""potentially releasable"", or ""potentially shippable""; to something useable for the users.

Increments should be potentially releasable; for starters, because it makes it easier for the customer to try it and give feedback. The feedback enables adaptation, which is essential to Agile.

Having an effective definition of ""Done"" increases transparency because everyone will know what we mean when we say an items is done.",Artifact Transparency
What's the vertical axis in a typical burn-down chart?,multiple-choice,The amount of remaining work,The progress,The technical debt,The capacity of the team,,,1,"The horizontal axis is time, the vertical axis is the remaining amount of work and the trend line shows the forecasted finish date if the Product Backlog and the team capacity stay the same.",Scrum Events
