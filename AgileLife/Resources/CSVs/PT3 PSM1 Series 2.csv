Which statement is right during the Sprint?,multiple-choice,"Some Sprint Backlog items would be replaced with items from the Product Backlog, if the priorities change",The scope may be re-negotiated as more is learned,Some Sprint Backlog items would be moved back to the Product Backlog to be completed in future Sprints,,,,2,"During the Sprint, the Product Backlog items in the Sprint Backlog would not be added or removed but as more is learned, the scope may be clarified and re-negotiated between the Product Owner and Development Team. This is mainly focused on the interpretation of the Product Backlog items and the tasks created by decomposing them.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What should happen to the ""Done"" Product Backlog items when the Sprint is cancelled?",multiple-choice,"They should be moved back to the Product Backlog, and would be taken care of in the future Sprints",They should be moved to the next Sprint Backlog.,"They will be reviewed, and if they are potentially releasable, the Product Owner typically accepts them.",,,,3,"The Development Team is responsible for the definition of ""Done"" rather than the Product Owner. So, if the Product Owner doubts the quality of the definition of ""Done"", he/she can discuss it with the team on the next Sprint Retrospective, so that if they agree, it would be adjusted for the next Sprint.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Product Owner is responsible for preparing the Sprint Goal before the Sprint Planning.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,The Sprint Goal is prepared during the Sprint Planning by the whole Scrum Team.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Scrum Master is a participant in Sprint Retrospective.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,All team members participate and try to find ways for improvement.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All interactions between the stakeholders and the Development Team should be through the Product Owner.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,The interactions can be through the Product Owner or during the Sprint Review. Other interactions are discouraged as they distract the developers.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is not allowed in Scrum?,multiple-choice,Refactoring,Hardening Sprints,Velocity tracking,Release planning,,,2,Hardening Sprints are not allowed because the subject of hardening should be continuously address throughout normal Sprints. All Sprints are the same in Scrum. Other options are not described in the framework but are good practices recommended for Scrum projects.,Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Sprint Backlog is baselined at the end of the Sprint Planning.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,We don't baseline any artifact in Scrum. The Sprint Backlog is dynamic and changes during the Sprint to include newly identified tasks.,Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All work that the developers should do originate from the Product Backlog,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,Everything they do is identified by decomposing the Product Backlog items.,Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
It is OK for the items at the bottom of the Product Backlog not to be as clear as those at the top.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Items at the bottom of the Product Backlog won't be developed soon, so, there's no need to spend too much time making them clear and add details; that would be some kind of upfront planning. Not that the items do not go to the bottom of the backlog because they are not clear or do not have enough detail; the only basis for order of items is the business value. When the item does not have enough detail and starts to go to the top of the Product Backlog, it should be refined by adding more detail.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Ordering the Product Backlog items is part of the Product Backlog refinement.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,"Product Backlog refinement is defined in the Scrum Guide as the act of adding detail, estimates and order to the Product Backlog items. Remember that the Product Backlog refinement is an ongoing activity and is not timeboxed. The rule is that it shouldn't take more than 10% of the developers' time.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Product Owner can ask the developers to order the Product Backlog items instead of him/her.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,The Product Owner can delegate his/her responsibilities to the development team but he/she stays accountable.,The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
The Product Owner can delegate some of his/her responsibilities to the Development Team.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,1,The Product Owner can delegate his/her responsibilities to the development team but he/she stays accountable.,The Scrum Team,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Scrum should be tailored for the project.,multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Unlike methodologies, the Scrum ""framework"" is not tailored because it's already limited to the essentials. Even the terms should not change let along adding or removing elements such as roles and events. However, you need to add many practices and techniques to the framework.",Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Our velocity was 250 at the end of the 6th Sprint. It has become 275 at the end of the 11th Sprint. Therefore, we're creating more value now, compared to the past.",multiple-choice,TRUE,FALSE,,,,,2,"Velocity and value are not related directly. Value is the benefit to cost ratio. Since we start with the most important items first, those remained for the 11th Sprint are expected to have less value compared to those delivered at the 6th Sprint.",Scrum Theory,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Which of the following roles can set the definition of ""Done""?",multiple-choice,The Scrum Team,The Scrum Master,The Development Team,The Product Owner,,,3,"The development organization may have a definition of ""Done"" composed for all projects in which case the team will use it as a minimum. Otherwise, the Development Team would be responsible for composing the definition of ""Done"". When multiple teams are working on the same product, there can be more than one definition of ""Done"", as long as they all have the minimums required by the development organization and can create an integrated Increment.",Artifact Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
When should the Product Backlog items be refined? (choose 2 answers),multi-select,Before the Sprint in which the item is supposed to be developed,The business analysts do it before it is time to develop the item,"During the Sprint, if they have not been refined in the previous Sprints",,,,"1,3","Product Backlog refinement is a continuous activity. When an item is at the top of the backlog, which means it will be developed in the near future, more refinements are usually needed to make sure it is clear and contains just enough details (not all possible details). It's preferred to have the items that will be selected in the Sprint Backlog completely refined before Sprint Planning; however, it's OK to have more refinement done during the development. Remember that there's no such thing as Sprint 0 and there's no time between two Sprints that can be spent on something such as refinement. The team is also cross-functional and does the a-z of the work needed for each item, including refinement; they don't use people from other parts of the company.",Scrum Artifacts,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"What does it mean to say a Product Backlog item is ""Done""? (Choose 3 answers)",multi-select,The item is ready for functional testing by the Product Owner,The item creates a software that is usable by the end user,No work left based on the Definition of Done,The item can be a part of a potentially releasable piece of software,All tasks identified for the item are done,The item is ready for user acceptance testing,"2,3,4","Items are ""Done"" when they are complete based on the definition of ""Done"". In that case, they would have the potential of creating a releasable/shippable Increment that is usable by the end user. Tests are also part of the work and items are not ""Done"" before the tests are complete; even the user acceptance tests. Quality requirements are part of the work but not all of it (eg non-functional features and development processes are also part of the work). We cannot trust the identified tasks because we might have missed some tasks and the sum of them do not conform to the definition of ""Done"".",Artifact Transparency,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Which of the following is designed to synchronize multiple teams working on the same product?,multiple-choice,Daily Scrum,Sprint Planning,Weekly status report,Scrum-of-scrums,,,4,"Daily Scrum is for synchronizing inside a team and Scrum-of-Scrums is for synchronizing multiple teams working on the same product. When the Daily Scrum is over, one representative from each team goes to a higher level daily stand-up to discuss the issues among teams. Note: scrum.org has recently introduced its scaled Scrum framework called Nexus. It doesn't have a scrum-of-scrum as described here, while there might still be some questions about it in the exam.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel a Sprint. However, the Development Team is trying to convince the Product Owner that the Sprint should be cancelled. What's the right response from the Scrum Master?",multiple-choice,It is OK,"The Scrum Master should stop this, because the Development Team does not have the authority to influence Sprint cancellation",The Scrum Master should encourage the Product Owner to discuss it with the customer first,The Scrum Master should be involved in making this decision,,,1,"Only the Product Owner can cancel a Sprint and the final decision belongs to him/her. However, this decision can be influenced by the customer, developers and Scrum Master.",Scrum Events,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
